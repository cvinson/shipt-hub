## Description
When you just want to see the relationships between users without all the cruft of code and issues, ShiptHub strips away the unnecessary distractions and allows you to focus on what is important. ShiptHub allows users to search Github by username and see a simple, infinitely-loading list of that user's followers, along with links to those users' ShiptHub pages and Github profiles.

## Hosted Version
ShiptHub is deployed to Heroku and you can play with it without installing it locally [here](https://shipt-hub.herokuapp.com).

## Installation and Usage
ShiptHub uses `yarn` for dependency management and tasks. [Yarn Installation Guide](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Dependency installation is done using the `yarn install` command:
```bash
$ yarn install
```

Once installed, ShiptHub can be run locally using the 'yarn start' command:
```bash
$ yarn start
```

## Testing
ShiptHub has a full suite of unit tests. To run all tests:
```bash
$ yarn test
```

To generate a coverage report:
```bash
$ yarn coverage
```
Once generated, the coverage report can be found in `./coverage`, and can be viewed in the browser by opening `./coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.

## Architectural Choices
ShiptHub is broken down into several components, the outermost being the App. Based on the given route, either the Search component or the Profile component will be displayed. The Search component is reused inside the Profile component.

The Profile component is wrapped with a ProfileContainer. I did this for 2 reasons; One was to accommodate the future implementation of a state container like Redux. Secondly, it made testing the component much simpler, since I could pass in the api service methods. If I were to make this project more robust, implementing a state container would be one of the first things I would do.

The Profile container also includes the `react-virtualized` component which only renders enough rows to display what is on the screen (plus a few more off screen to make scrolling look good). Scrolling near the end of the currently loaded rows automatically triggers the loading of a new page.

User and follower components are also broken out into their own components. A single instance of the user component is displayed at the top of the Profile component, and the Follower component is used in the row rendering method of the react-virtualized list.

## Library Choices
I chose React, and specifically the stack used in  `create-react-app` because it is the stack I have been using the most over the last couple years. I also chose to use MaterialUI components because they are a set of well-designed, well-tested components that comply to Material guidelines. I am fairly familiar with this library and have made some minor contributions to it.

In most cases I chose to use the `await`/`async` syntax from ES2017. This is not a syntax I have used in the past, but I have been wanting to try it and I really like the clarity it brings to most situations.

I chose Jest for testing because of its speed and matchers which were designed for a React ecosystem. I also love the simplicity and ease of updating that is provided by Jest Snapshots. Enzyme was used to render and serialize components in tests. Coverage is instrumented in Istanbul.

## Generated Code
Initial code was generated by `create-react-app`, but most of it have been replaced with the exception of most of `src/index.js`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
